# a program that determines whether a user input is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backwards as
forwards. For example, 12321, “anna” and “able was I ere I saw elba” arepalindromes. Ideally, the program should ignore upper- and lowercase. (So, 
“Anna” would be a palindrome.)
